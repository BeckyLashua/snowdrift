Your job is to create, from scratch, two HTML documents and a CSS document to style said HTML documents. 

The first HTML document will represent a login screen for the blog that you will be creating. It must contain a <form> element, with two <input> elements for a username and password.

The second HTML document will represent the home page of a user of your blog. It must contain spaces for the user's bio, user's blogs, user's subscriptions, and at least one other thing of your choosing. NOTE: The blog need not be functional, all I'm looking for is a "wire-frame" for the page, i.e., a visual mock-up of the page.

Additionally, you are to INCLUDE a css file (that is, you are to write a separate .css file and include it in BOTH HTML documents) which you will use to style both documents in a consistent way. You must use at least 5 unique CSS properties. You are being graded in part on presentation, so do your best to make your blog look nice.

As always, ask for clarification if you need it.
